1. **Selectors and their prorities**

In CSS, an ID selector has higher priority than a tag selector. When applying styles to HTML elements, CSS uses a set of rules to determine which styles should be applied when there are conflicting styles targeting the same element.

The order of priority from highest to lowest is as follows:

1. Inline styles: Styles applied directly to an element using the `style` attribute.
2. ID selectors: Styles applied using the ID selector (`#exampleId`).
3. Class selectors: Styles applied using class selectors (`.exampleClass`).
4. Attribute selectors: Styles applied using attribute selectors (`[attribute=value]`).
5. Tag selectors: Styles applied using tag selectors (`div`, `p`, `h1`, etc.).
6. Universal selectors: Styles applied using the universal selector (`*`).
7. Inherited styles: Some properties are automatically inherited from parent elements.

If multiple selectors target the same element and have conflicting styles, the one with higher specificity takes precedence. ID selectors have the highest specificity, followed by class selectors, attribute selectors, and finally tag selectors. It's generally recommended to use classes for styling and reserve IDs for JavaScript or unique elements due to their higher specificity. This helps to keep the CSS code more maintainable and flexible.
